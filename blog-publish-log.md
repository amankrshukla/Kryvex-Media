# Kryvex Media — Daily Blog Publish Log

Structured, dated log of what the daily blog automation Routine actually
published each day — added 2026-09-30 so the Daily Combined Status
Report Routine has a reliable, structured source to read (matching the
pattern already used by seo-keyword-optimization-log.md,
reddit-growth-log.md, and backlink-outreach-log.md). The blog Routine's
own full process/rules still live in CLAUDE.md under "Daily blog
automation."

Anti-fabrication rule applies: every entry is real — real topic
selection method, real word count, real deploy run number/conclusion,
real sitemap resubmission confirmation. Never log a claim without having
actually checked it that run.

## Log

### 2026-09-30 — log created

No new entry for today (blog post for today was already published and
reported earlier in this session, before this log existed — see chat
history / git log for "How to Choose a Web Design Company"). Going
forward, every run appends a dated entry here in this format:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD
- Topic/query: <real topic>, selection method: <GSC query | fallback reason>
- URL: <real published URL>
- Word count: <real count>
- Deploy: run #<N>, conclusion: <success|cancelled|failure>
- Sitemap resubmission: <confirmed message | not confirmed>
```

### 2026-10-01
- Topic/query: GSC 90-day query pull checked first — near-total volume
  is hyper-local "agency/company in [city]" queries already served by
  the programmatic geo pages (consistent with the standing note).
  Fallback method used: a real, unaddressed topic within Kryvex's
  actual service scope — "Google Ads vs Meta Ads: where should a small
  business spend first," tying to the real `/services/ppc/` and
  `/services/meta-ads/` pages. Existing posts on each platform
  individually (`google-ads-for-small-businesses`,
  `small-business-guide-to-meta-ads`) are single-platform guides, not a
  comparison, so no topic overlap.
- URL: https://kryvexmedia.com/blog/google-ads-vs-meta-ads-small-business/
- Word count: 1,743 (verified via isolated `<main>` word count script)
- Deploy: run #193, head_sha `6e3cc8bd1`, conclusion: pending at time of
  this entry — still `in_progress` after several poll cycles; will
  confirm and correct this line once it completes rather than assume
  success.
- Sitemap resubmission: confirmed — "Sitemap
  'https://kryvexmedia.com/sitemap.xml' successfully submitted for site
  'sc-domain:kryvexmedia.com'"
